    <h1>Liver Lobe Torsion in Rabbits</h1>
      <p>The rabbit liver is composed of five lobes -- the right hepatic lobe, caudate and quadrate lobes are single, 
         and the left hepatic one is separated in lateral and medial parts.[1] Liver lobe torsion, also known as <i>hepatic 
         lobe torsion</i> or <i>hepatic infarction</i>, occurs when a lobe of the liver twists about an axis perpendicular to the organ's 
         base of support which causes venous congestion and eventually diffuse necrosis of the lobe.[2] In most cases it is the 
         pendulous caudal process of the caudal lobe, which sits over the right kidney, that twists.[3]</p>
